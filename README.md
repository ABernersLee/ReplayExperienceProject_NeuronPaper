# ReplayExperienceProject_NeuronPaper
Code from the Replay Experience project for the Neuron paper. 

README_Run_ReplayExperience.m has a breakdown of how the scripts are used and which scripts generated the data and figures for which parts of the data. 
CircStat2012a and MatlabImportExport_v6.0.0 were used as well and can be downloaded elsewhere.

If you have questions/comments please feel free to reach out to me by email.
